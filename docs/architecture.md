# Architecture Overview

Describe your infrastructure at a high level:

- Environments: dev, staging, prod
- Core components: networking, compute, storage, CI/CD, observability
- Tools: Terraform/Ansible/Kubernetes (choose what applies)
- Security boundaries, secrets management, and access patterns

Include diagrams if helpful and link to ADRs for key decisions.
